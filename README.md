            ðŸŒºTHE STORY OF DAYANG SENANDUNG ðŸŒº

Once upon a time, in a peaceful and prosperous kingdom, there lived a king and queen who longed dearly for a child. For many years, they prayed and wished to be blessed with an heir to the throne.

At last, their prayers were answered. The queen became pregnant, and the whole kingdom celebrated the joyous news. However, when the baby girl was born, everyone was shocked. The child had pitch-black skin, unlike any other member of the royal family.

Still, the king and queen named her Dayang Senandung, inspired by her sweet, melodious voice that sounded like a gentle lullaby.

Sadly, not everyone welcomed her birth with open hearts. Some people mocked her appearance, claiming she was cursed or a bad omen. Only her parents loved her unconditionally and raised her with care.

As Dayang Senandung grew up, she became a kind, intelligent, graceful girl, gifted with a beautiful singing voice. Yet, despite her many virtues, she lived a lonely life, often rejected because of her looks.



ðŸ‘‘ The Princeâ€™s VisitðŸ‘‘

One day, a prince from a distant kingdom named Tengku Zainal visited the land. While walking in the royal garden, he heard a mesmerizing voice singing from afar. His heart was immediately drawn to the sound, and he sought to find its source.

When he met Dayang Senandung, he was taken aback by her appearance. But over time, he came to know her true self â€” gentle, wise, and kind. Eventually, he fell in love, not with her looks, but with her heart and soul.

Despite protests from some family members and the people, Tengku Zainal proposed and married Dayang Senandung out of sincere love.


âœ¨ The Curse is Liftedâœ¨

Not long after their marriage, Dayang Senandung gave birth to a baby boy. At that very moment, something miraculous happened â€” the curse that had haunted her since birth was broken. Her skin turned radiant and fair, more beautiful than anyone had ever seen.

Everyone who had once mocked her stood in awe and regret.


ðŸŒ¼ The EndingðŸŒ¼

Dayang Senandung lived happily ever after with her husband and son. She was respected as a wise and graceful queen, admired by the people for her strength and inner beauty. Her life became a lasting reminder that a personâ€™s true worth lies in their character, not in physical appearance.
